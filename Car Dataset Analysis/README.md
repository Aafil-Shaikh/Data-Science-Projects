# Car Data Analysis

This project is a personal data analysis project that aims to analyze data related to cars. The project contains an input raw data file in CSV format, an IPython notebook file, and a result spreadsheet.

## Data Source

The input raw data for this project is dummy data that was used for the purpose of this personal project. It contains information on various cars, such as the make, dimensions, other technical features and price.

## Data Cleaning and Transformation

The first step in this project was to clean and transform the data. The following steps were taken:

- Removed duplicates and null values
- Corrected data types where necessary (e.g., converting string data to numeric data)
- Created new columns based on existing data

## Libraries Used

The following Python libraries were used in this project:

- Pandas: for data manipulation and analysis
- numpy: for numeric computations

To install these libraries, open a command prompt or terminal window and run the following commands:

```bash
  pip install pandas numpy
```

This will install the required libraries on your machine. Once the libraries are installed, you can launch Jupyter Notebook and open the IPython notebook file to start analyzing the data.

## Data Analysis

After cleaning and transforming the data, it was exported to Microsoft Office Excel and various data analysis techniques were applied. This included:

- Exploratory data analysis to gain insights into the data
- Creating pivot tables to summarize the data
- Creating charts and graphs to visualize the data
- Creating a dashboard to present the findings

## Result Spreadsheet

The result spreadsheet contains the cleaned and transformed data, pivot tables and charts, as well as the dashboard created during the analysis. It can be found in the `Results.xlsx` file of this project.

## How to Use

To use this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine
2. Open the IPython notebook file `Car Data Analysis.ipynb` using Jupyter Notebook or any other compatible software.
3. Follow the step-by-step instructions in the notebook to analyze the data and create the result spreadsheet.
