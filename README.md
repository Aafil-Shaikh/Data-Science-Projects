# Data Science Projects

This repository contains a collection of mini data analytic projects that I have been working on. The projects consist of Kaggle notebook files and Excel dashboards, showcasing various data analysis techniques and insights. More projects will be continuously added to the repository.

## Project Folders

1. [Kaggle Notebooks](/kaggle-notebooks): This folder contains the Kaggle notebook files for the data science projects. Each project is organized in a separate notebook, providing detailed explanations, code, and visualizations.

2. [Excel Dashboards](/excel-dashboards): In this folder, you will find Excel dashboard files representing the data analysis results of specific projects. The dashboards offer interactive visualizations and summaries of the key findings.

Feel free to navigate to the respective folders to explore the projects and gain insights from the data analysis. Contributions and feedback are always welcome!
